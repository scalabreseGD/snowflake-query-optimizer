# Application Plan and Structure (Streamlit-Based)

Below is a high-level plan for how you might structure a **Streamlit** application that ingests SQL queries (and associated performance metrics), identifies common antipatterns, and suggests improvements/fixes. This includes “agentic” improvements such as recommending new partitions, materialized views, etc.

---

## 1. Overall Flow

1. **Analysis Prep**  
   1. **Collect Performance Metrics**  
      - Pull data from your data warehouse (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, etc.)  
      - Include execution time, cost, frequency, and other relevant metrics.  
   2. **Filter by Cost and Frequency**  
      - A Python step filters out queries below certain thresholds (configurable).  
      - Thresholds could be set via a config file, environment variables, or Streamlit widgets.  
   3. **Categorize Query Patterns (LLM)**  
      - Use an LLM to identify typical antipatterns or suboptimal patterns.  
      - Potential categories include: “Suboptimal Join,” “Missing WHERE clause,” “Excessive DISTINCT,” “Non-SARGable Condition,” etc.  
   4. **Assemble a Candidate Query Set**  
      - Gather the queries worth analyzing (most costly, frequent, or flagged) for further inspection.

2. **Baseline Improvements**  
   1. **Identify and Repair Common Antipatterns (LLM)**  
      - Prompt structure might look like:  
        - `(1) Antipattern + SQL statement`  
        - `(2) Instructions: "Please fix and optimize this query."`  
        - `(3) Reasoning or “Chain of Thought” (optional)`  
        - `(4) Examples of Fixes`  
      - The LLM returns a candidate fix.  
   2. **SQL Validator**  
      - A validation step (Python library or data warehouse “EXPLAIN” statement) checks if proposed SQL is valid.  
      - If invalid, feed it back into the LLM or mark for manual review.

3. **Further (Agentic) Improvements**  
   - Once table metadata is available (table size, cardinalities, existing cluster/partition keys), the LLM can propose:  
     1. **Cluster Key Suggestions**  
     2. **New Partition Suggestions**  
     3. **Materialized Views**  
   - Provide rationale: “This table is large and frequently joined on `customer_id`; consider clustering by `customer_id`,” etc.

4. **Deployment Options**  
   - **Option 1**: Run as a batch job (e.g. daily/weekly).  
   - **Option 2**: Build triggers that call your system whenever expensive/long-running jobs are detected.

5. **Manual Query Analysis Mode**
   1. **Query Input**
      - Direct SQL query input through text area
      - File upload support for SQL files
      - Support for multiple query analysis in batch
   2. **Schema Information**
      - Optional table schema input
      - Table statistics and metadata input
      - Existing indexes and materialized views
   3. **Analysis Features**
      - Syntax validation and formatting
      - Query complexity scoring
      - Cost estimation (if schema provided)
      - Antipattern detection
      - Category classification:
        - Data Manipulation
        - Reporting
        - ETL
        - Analytics
        - etc.
   4. **Optimization Suggestions**
      - Query rewrite suggestions
      - Index recommendations
      - Materialization strategies
      - Partitioning advice
   5. **Batch Processing**
      - Upload multiple queries
      - Bulk analysis and optimization
      - Export results to CSV/Excel
   6. **History and Versioning**
      - Save analyzed queries
      - Track optimization history
      - Compare different versions
      - Export optimization reports
