# Snowflake Query Optimizer

An intelligent SQL query optimization tool powered by Azure OpenAI, designed to analyze and optimize Snowflake queries for better performance.

## Features

### Query Analysis Modes

1. **Query History Analysis**
   - Analyze historical queries from your Snowflake instance
   - Filter by execution time, data scanned, and date range
   - View detailed performance metrics
   - Get intelligent optimization suggestions

2. **Manual Query Analysis**
   - Input queries directly with syntax highlighting
   - Upload SQL files for analysis
   - Batch process multiple queries
   - Add schema information for better optimization
   - Real-time query formatting

3. **Advanced Snowflake Optimization**
   - Specialized optimizations for Snowflake
   - Clustering key analysis
   - Materialized view suggestions
   - Search optimization recommendations
   - Caching strategy optimization
   - Partitioning analysis

### Core Features

- **Intelligent Analysis**
  - SQL syntax validation and formatting
  - Query complexity scoring
  - Antipattern detection
  - Performance impact assessment
  - LLM-powered optimization suggestions

- **Visual Comparison**
  - Side-by-side query comparison
  - Detailed diff highlighting
  - Color-coded changes
  - Easy copy-to-clipboard functionality

- **Schema Analysis**
